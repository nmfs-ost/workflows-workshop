This repository houses the agenda, materials, and communication for the NOAA Fisheries Stock Assessment Workflows Workshops being held starting in 2026! Please use this README to help navigate within our repository and find out our current progress and plans in real time.

# Background

The workflows of stock assessment scientists across the U.S. are highly variable and all consistently face similar issues including lack of automation, challenging data wrangling, increased requests for analyses, and more. A team with the National Stock Assessment Program at NOAA Fisheries HQ set about addressing some of these needs by identifying parts of the workflow scientists needed help in. While there were needs to improve parts of the workflow at every step, the team and a steering committee decided to first approach the lowest hanging fruit, reporting. The goal of this project was to establish a semi-automated system for generating reports in order to reduce time completing mundane and tedious tasks that, with some effort, could be automated. From there, [{asar}](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar) and [{stockplotr}](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr) were built along with beginning to establish a standard set of guidelines for stock assessment reports.

## Curriculum

The curriculum is comprised of three days of tutorial-based materials (see the left sidebar for [Day 1](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_1/day_1.html), [Day 2](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_2/day_2.html), and [Day 3](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_3/day_3.html) links). We have dedicated a lot of time to the documentation of {asar} and {stockplotr}, so we encourage everyone to visit these sites prior to the workshop.
