# Good data science practices

## Organization

1. Use the `here` R package

## Seeking help

1. Create a reproducible example ("reprex") to allow your helper to reproduce your issue and get a clear sense of the context. See [the tidyverse's "do's and don'ts"](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html) for making reprexes.
