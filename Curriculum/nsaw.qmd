## Workshop overview
### Purpose and benefits to you

By the end of this workshop, we hope that you come away with the knowledge and confidence to write your next stock assessment report using a *reproducible, efficient, and transparent workflow based on {asar} and {stockplotr}*.

{asar} is designed to:

- Reduce the barriers of entry to using Quarto
- Familiarize stock assessment scientists with reproducible workflows
- Shift towards a more concise reporting format
- Move towards a more centralized workflow across NOAA Fisheries

# Markdown

[According to RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html), *markdown* is "an easy-to-write plain text format"; not exactly a language, but a formatting style. It allows you to format text reproducibly-- without pressing buttons.

## Common uses in {asar} reports

R Markdown uses a simple syntax for formatting your text. Here are some of the most common formatting options:

  * **Headers**
      * `#` signifies a top-level header
      * `##` signifies a second-level header (etc.)
  * **Emphasis**
      * `*italic*` for *italic* text
      * `**bold**` for **bold** text
  * **Lists**
      * **Unordered lists:** Use `*` or `-` at the beginning of a line.
      * **Ordered lists:** Use numbers followed by a period.
  * **Links**
      * `[link text](URL)`
  * **Math**
    * **Inline math:** Wrap your equation in single dollar signs: `$A = \pi * r^2$`
    * **Block equations:** Wrap your equation in double dollar signs to display it on its own line:
    ```
    $$
    E = mc^2
    $$
    ```

::: {.callout-tip}
Open the [markdown vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/markdown_notation.html) to learn about other markdown capabilities including tables, footnotes, subscripts, and more!
:::

# Quarto

Quarto is an ideal platform for building reproducible reports, many of which contain markdown. These reports are denoted with a .qmd (Quarto Markdown) extension type. For those familiar with R markdown, Quarto is like a more flexible and powerful version of that.

So, why should you Quarto to build reports?

* It allows you to combine narrative text, source code (like R, Python, LaTeX, and more), and the outputs of that code (like tables and figures) into a single, polished, dynamic document. When you "knit" the document, the code is executed, and all of those components are inserted into the final report.

* Anyone with the same files can reproduce that document, which goes a long way in promoting scientific integrity.

* You can produce reports in several formats like HTML, PDF, and Word.

* Using a platform like Quarto *saves time and reduces errors*. If your data changes, you don't have to manually rerun your analysis and copy/paste the results. You just re-knit the document, and everything is updated automatically.

## Components of Quarto reports

### YAML

The YAML is the block of text at the very top of your main .qmd file, enclosed by triple dashes (---). It provides metadata for your document-- i.e., how to build the report.

Common settings in the YAML include:

* title
* author
* date
* format (For {asar}, this will be PDF or HTML)

Here is an example of a basic YAML:

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Stock Assessment Report"
author: "Patrick Star"
date: today
---
```

### Parameters

Parameters allow you to create dynamic reports. You can define parameters in the YAML header and then reference them in your text and code.

For example, you could have a parameter for the species you're writing about:

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Stock Assessment Report"
author: "Patrick Star"
date: today
params:
  species: "Petrale sole"
---
```

Then, in the body of your report, you can reference this parameter like this:

"The native range of \`params\$species\` spans from..."

When you knit the document, \`params\$species\` will be replaced with "Petrale sole".


### References and Bibliography

You can easily add citations to your report. We provide an `asar_references.bib` file in the "report" folder with hundreds of citations for you to reference, though you can add your own to the file too.

To cite a reference in the text, use the `@` symbol followed by the citation key (e.g., `@Biddle_1992`). Quarto will automatically format the citation and add it to the "References" section towards the end of your report. The bib file will be referenced in your {asar} report's YAML.

Here's an example entry from the .bib file:

````
@article{Biddle_1992,
  title={Repton and the Vikings},
  volume={66},
  DOI={10.1017/S0003598X00081023},
  number={250}, journal={Antiquity},
  author={Biddle, Martin and Kjølbye-Biddle, Birthe},
  year={1992},
  pages={36–51}
}
````
## Tips for Quarto documents
### Modular setup with a skeleton

When you run `asar::create_template()`, you will receive a "report" folder with several files within it. One of the most important files is what we call the "skeleton": a .qmd file containing chunks that run *other* files, then places the rendered contents of those files within one report.

Those *other* files are what we call "child documents". For example, your report introduction will be written in a child document. Your figures and tables will be placed in respective child docs, too.

This setup avoids placing your entire report in one massive .qmd file, facilitates asynchronous collaboration with your colleagues, and keeps your project organized (in a "modular" fashion).

### Relative pathnames

::: {.callout-important}
Only files with paths relative to the Quarto doc will load!
:::

Quarto projects are self-contained such that it can only find files if you tell it where to look *relative to the location of the .qmd file*. To Quarto, the location of that .qmd file essentially becomes the root of your directory.

For example, imagine your project has this structure:

```verbatim
report/
├── SAR_species_skeleton.qmd
├── 01_executive_summary.qmd
├── 02_introduction.qmd
└── extra_data/
    └── red_fish.csv
    └── blue_fish.csv
```

To load 'red_fish.csv' inside SAR_species_skeleton.qmd, you would use a relative path:

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_data <- read.csv("extra_data/red_fish.csv")
```

This would work *even if your working directory is not the "report" folder.*

# {asar}: Automated Stock Assessment Reporting

In this section we will cover the basics of {asar} by generating a stock assessment report and going through basic navigation of the template.

## Overview of {asar}-based reporting workflow

Main steps for creating a stock assessment report with {asar}:

1. Install packages
2. Convert model output into format usable by {asar}
3. Create the report skeleton
4. Make child docs containing figures and tables (made with {stockplotr} or by other means)
5. Fill in child docs with text
6. Render report
7. Add accessibility features (PDF tags and alternative text for figures)

::: {.callout-tip}
Open the [asar cheatsheet](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/asar_cheatsheet.pdf) for a visual overview of the main workflow!
:::

## Recommended workflow

We *highly* recommend using a project-based workflow. This involves creating an R project for each report, which facilitates returning to your session and maintaining files. Using either a project or GitHub repository will help you in the long run.

To create a new R project in Rstudio:

File > New Project > New or Existing Directory

::: {.callout-important}
If you use VSCode or Positron for your IDE, by navigating to a folder on your computer, it will automatically initialize a project-like environment.
:::

## The main functions

{asar} revolves around a few primary functions and contains several support functions that help make the template. While most are accessible to the user, they would not perform helpful functions for them. Today, we will focus on the following functions:

- `asar::create_template()`
- `stockplotr::convert_output()` (This function is now located within {stockplotr} but is useful for building {asar} reports)
    
### `asar::create_template()`

**What it does:**

Generates a set of files that setup a stock assessment report with its supporting files.

Within the created files is the "skeleton file" which drives the render of the entire report. For those familiar with Rmarkdown or Quarto books, this is operating similar to a .yml file. The other quarto files found in your folder will be what we refer to as "child documents", or child docs for short. These
are the actual files that you will fill in when writing your report. These are the bulk of your content!

**Try it out!**

`create_template()` contains *A LOT* of arguments that allow the user to customize their document how
they want. The function contains a set of defaults that would produce a template that could be rendered,
but contains no real information relevant to the target stock.

So, let's do more than just create a blank template! The following arguments are some key parts to fill in for a specific stock assessment report:

| Argument | Options    |
|----------|------------|
| format   | pdf, html |
| type     | SAR, pfmc, safe, nemt |
| office   | afsc, pifsc, nefsc, nwfsc sefsc, swfsc |
| region   |  - |
| species  |  - |
| spp_latin | - |
| year | - |
| authors | - |
| file_dir | - |


```{r}
#| label: basic-ex
#| eval: false
# Adjust below example based on audience
library(asar)
library(here)
create_template(
  format = "pdf", # optional "html"
  type = "SAR", # add'l options: "safe", "nemt", "pfmc"
  office = "NWFSC",
  region = "U.S. West Coast",
  species = "Petrale sole",
  spp_latin = "Eopsetta jordani",
  authors = c("Samantha Schiano" = "OST", "Jane Doe" = "SWFSC-LJCA"),
  file_dir = getwd() # folder where the "report" folder will be saved
)
```

**Run it!**

You should see a folder called "**report**" where you indicated in the argument `file_dir`. It should have a set up that looks like this:

![The contents of an asar-generated template found in the report folder.](Day_2/images/asar_files.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of files that should appear in the 'report' folder, including '01_executive_summary.qmd', '02_introduction.qmd', '03_data.qmd', and more."}

::: {.callout-note}
You should see a variety of messages reported in the console to indicate
that it worked! For a blank template with no errors, it should look like this:

![](Day_2/images/blank_template_output_messages.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of console text expected when `create_template()` is run successfully."}

#### Let's take a tour of the content we created!

##### The skeleton

![Diagram showing different blocks of content found in the Quarto yaml within the skeleton.qmd file.](Day_2/images/asar_skeleton.png){fig-alt="A figure showing seven rectangles on top of one another, portraying the order of content in a Quarto yaml. Sections include 'Yaml (Formatting and input information)', 'Parameters R chunk', 'Preamble R chunk', 'Disclaimer', 'Citation', 'Report content ('child docs'): Executive Summary', an ellipsis to separate the blocks, and then a final block ('Report content ('Child docs'): Appendix')."}

As previously mentioned, the skeleton file controls the rest of the report. This is the file you go to to compile your report, change formatting, or add quantities to reference in your document.

::: {.callout-note}
You shouldn't have to adjust the yaml much, if at all. However, if your `species` does not match with an image in our [database](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/tree/main/inst/resources/spp_img), then you can edit the yaml to add a filepath leading to your own cover image.
:::

## Outside today's scope
Learn about the [{asar} yaml](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_2/day_2.html#the-skeleton) on our Day 2 page!
:::

##### Parameterization

Quarto has a cool feature that allows users to parameterize their document by utilizing markdown's ability to render in-line code throughout your writing. In the yaml, there are pre-added parameters of the species, Latin name, region, and office. These are called in through an R chunk after the YAML.

You have two options for calling these parameters in your writing.

1. \` r params$species \` (Quarto parameterization)
2. \` r species \` ({asar} use of parameterization)


##### The preamble

The preamble is an R chunk that loads in a script called "preamble.R" which extracts key quantities commonly referenced in stock assessment reports. This will only work with a standard results file converted using `asar::convert_output()`, which we will get to shortly.

![A screenshot showing lines of code in an R chunk within the skeleton file containing various quantities pulled from the preamble.R script.](Day_2/images/preamble.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the preamble, with the R chunk option 'eval: false' highlighted."}

The quantities in found in this chunk can be referenced in-line throughout the document:

\` r R0 \`

:::

**Let's find the preamble and see the methods to edit it**

##### The content

The "child docs" are where you as the assessment author or contributor report out the information you need to include. The template is highly modular so there are files for each section of the report and sometimes files for subsections. The default {asar} template creates child docs following the NOAA standard stock assessment report guidelines consisting of the following:

- executive summary
- introduction
- data
- assessment (modelling and results)
- discussion
- acknowledgements
- references
- tables
- figures
- appendix

Each child doc contains pre-determined headers and labels for the author to reference back to throughout the document. There are also descriptions within each section that depcit what you should report on throughout the document. You can either keep or remove these notes once the document is finished, either way, they will not be included in your final report.

Child docs are not intended to be rendered on their own, but only from the skeleton as a whole!

::: {.callout-important}
We are advising everyone that if required content is needed beyond the standard guidelines, that it gets placed in the appendix; however we encourage everyone to think about the importance of the content in terms of review for management versus CIE or SSC review.
:::

<!-- **Demo of child docs and adding quantities from the preamble into your document** -->

Please add the following text into your "introduction" section:

```{verbatim}
The stock assessment for `r params$species` was conducted by the `r params$office` in `r params$region`. The spawning biomass at maximum sustainable yield for the current assessment year (`r end_year`) was `r sb_msy`. You can find more information on the results of this assessment in @sec-assessment-results. The guidelines for this report follow those outlined in @NOAA_2020.
```

### `stockplotr::convert_output()`

**What it does:**

This function, which was **formerly located within {asar} but has been moved to {stockplotr}**, converts an output file from a stock assessment model to a standard format. This file can be used to extract quantities within the preamble and to build figures and tables with {stockplotr} (covered in [Day 3](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_3/day_3.html)).

The `convert_output` function currently accepts output from Stock Synthesis (Report.sso) version 3.30 and higher, Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM; output.rda), or Fisheries Integrated Modelling System (FIMS; R object). We are actively working on expanding the `convert_output` function to be compatible with all major U.S. stock assessment models. This function takes a lot of resources to develop, so any contribution to the package is welcome! If you have a model that is not currently compatible with `stockplotr::convert_output()`, please navigate to [our article](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/stockplotr/articles/convert_output_details.html) describing the function and how to get your output in the same format as those produced from the converter!

**Let's try it out!**

We have uploaded an example Report.sso file in the workshop GitHub, but if you have a compatible output file, we encourage you to use your own.

```{r}
#| label: conout-ex
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
#| messages: false
# Identify output file
output_file <- file.path(here::here(), "example_output", "Report.sso")
# convert the output
petrale <- stockplotr::convert_output(
  output_file,
  save_dir = file.path(getwd(), "report", "petrale_conout.rda"))
```

**Run it!**

```{r eval=FALSE}
petrale
```

![A screenshot of the first 8 columns and 10 rows of data from a standard output tibble converted from a stock synthesis Report.sso file.](Day_2/images/petrale_conout.png)

::: {.callout-tip}
`convert_output()` will recognize which model the results file came from as well as fleet names. In the rare case either of these are incorrect, the function contains arguments of `model` and `fleet_names` which you as the user can indicate for the function.

If you are explicitly stating fleet names, make sure they are in the order you expect them to be found in the file.
:::

#### Format of converted output

The converted output is a tibble that reframes and reshapes your data. The tibble contains each output value as a row with its error and any associated indexing values.

:::


## Advanced {asar} workflow

Now we are going to walk-through a more complex use of {asar} by

- Customizing our sections
- Reorganizing section order

### Create-your-own

There are three additional template options available to users to use while we work to set standard assessment report guidelines across the country. They include SAFE reports, NEFSC management track reports, and PFMC guidelines. Not only thing, but you have the ability to add new sections either within the current outline or in individual sections or even select which sections of the standard template you want to create your report around.

Today, we will be going over how to customize your template by adding a new section along with updating your current report when the need arises..

### Rerendering report

We understand that it's easy to forget to enter in all of the information you need for a report on it's initial creation! Because of this, we made the argument "rerender_skeleton" that adds on any new information to the skeleton file that you might want such as additional authors, a new species image, parameters, or anything that is open for you to customize in the skeleton file. 

You COULD do this manually, but using the function both allows you to create a record of your changes (making it more reproducible) *and* makes the Quarto yaml less intimidating to new users!

::: {.callout-note}
You can run re-render skeleton as often as you want, it will always edit the current skeleton in the folder. Please note: any additional skeleton files will make this process fail. The process will also verify that you want to overwrite the current skeleton and either keep or replace the key quantities file.
:::

#### Our changes: new parameters, additional author, and a new section

:::

Now, I need to add my co-authors to my report especially since I wasn't sure who was going to be working on it at the time I created my report template. After review of our terms of reference, I noticed that I needed a section to document my changes to the model, so let's add that in too.

```{r eval=FALSE}
asar::create_template(
  rerender_skeleton = TRUE,
  file_dir = file.path(getwd(), "report"),
  authors = c("John Doe"="NEFSC", "Jane Doe"="NOAA"),
  model_results = file.path(getwd(), "report", "std_output.rda"),
  custom = TRUE,

# Introduction to {stockplotr}

## Package information

This package is an ongoing process to gather contributions in order to expand the number of pre-made tables and figures that can be incorporated into a stock assessment report. All objects are intended to be generalized and not specific to any region.

{stockplotr} also contains `convert_output()`: the function used to convert model results into a standardized output (as explained in a [previous section](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/nsaw.html#stockplotrconvert_output)). This standardized output is the input for the {stockplotr} plotting functions, below (the `dat` argument).

The following table contains figures and tables that are available in {stockplotr}:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `plot_abundance_at_age()` | abundance-at-age |
| `plot_biomass_at_age()` | biomass-at-age |
| `plot_biomass()` | biomass time series |
| `plot_catch_comp()` | catch compositions |
| `plot_fishing_mortality` | fishing mortality time series |
| `plot_indices()` | indices |
| `plot_landings()` | landings time series |
| `plot_natural_mortality()` | natural mortality time series or at-age |
| `plot_recruitment_deviations()` | recruitment deviations |
| `plot_recruitment()` | recruitment time series |
| `plot_spawn_recruitment()` | spawn recruitment relationship |
| `plot_spawning_biomass()` | spawning biomass time series |
| `table_landings()` | landings time series by fleet or other indexing |
| `table_bnc()`- *coming soon* | biomass, landings, and catch time series |
| `table_harvest_projection()`- *coming soon* | harvest projection table according to SAFE standards (to be expanded nationally) |
| `tables_indices()`- *coming soon* | indices by fleet |

Each automated function returns either a `ggplot2` object (figure) or `gt` object (table). This allows for further customization of the output if desired by using the notation you are familiar with. For a figure, you can continue to add onto the plot any other `ggplot2` function or extension using the plus (+) operator. For a table, please use the native pipe (|>) when adding additional formatting, rows, or other pieces to the object.

## Example Figure

Run the example below. It should result in a line graph showing biomass over time, including a reference line for the biomass unfished.

```{r eval = FALSE}
stockplotr::plot_biomass(
  dat = petrale, # dataset
  geom = "line", # show a line graph
  group = NULL, # don't group by sex, fleet, etc.
  facet = NULL, # not faceting by any variable
  ref_line = "unfished", # set reference line at unfished
  unit_label = "mt", # unit label: metric tons
  scale_amount = 1, # do not scale biomass
  relative = FALSE, # show biomass, NOT relative biomass
  interactive = TRUE, # prompt user for MODULE_NAME in console
  module = NULL # MODULE_NAME not specified here
)

### Customizing

All figures will automatically identify any indexing variables in the data such as fleet, area, or sex. You can use the `group` and `facet` arguments to modify how these indexing variables are displayed in the figure. You can also modify other arguments such as `geom`, `ref_line`, and `relative` to change the appearance of the figure. 

Here are some examples of how to customize the biomass figure:

#### Change the reference line to a specific value (e.g., 260)
  
In this example we are also telling the function which module to select in order to by-pass this step. We plan to remove grouping of some modules in the future.

```{r eval = FALSE}
stockplotr::plot_biomass(
  dat = petrale,
  geom = "line",
  group = NULL,
  facet = NULL,
  ref_line = c("target" = 260), # changed from "unfished"
  unit_label = "mt",
  scale_amount = 1,
  relative = FALSE,
  interactive = FALSE, # changed from TRUE
  module = "TIME_SERIES" # indicate module name here
)
```

![](Day_3/images/day3_ex_plt2.png)

#### Plot relative biomass and change the size of the line
  
In this example, we still are bypassing module selection and we are automatically extracting the reference line value from the data. However, now we are using this reference value to plot relative biomass and changing the linewidth to 2 (an argument inherited from `ggplot2::geom_line()`).

::: {.callout-note}
If you were plotting a scatterplot (`geom = 'point'`) or area plot (`geom = 'area'`), you could add arguments associated with `geom_point()` and `geom_area()`, respectively.
:::

```{r eval = FALSE}
stockplotr::plot_biomass(
  dat = petrale,
  geom = "line",
  group = NULL,
  facet = NULL,
  ref_line = c("target" = 260),
  unit_label = "mt",
  scale_amount = 1,
  relative = TRUE, # changed from FALSE
  interactive = FALSE,
  module = "TIME_SERIES",
  linewidth = 2 # increase width of lines
)
```

## Exporting

You can export any table or plot along with their associated caption and alternative text (figures only) in the format of an rda file. An rda is an R data file that stores R objects and preserves their structure. In this case, you can think of an rda file exported from {stockplotr} as a list of objects.

Each plot or table has the option to export it as an rda. This rda is a list of 3 associated components for the plot/table to be used in a stock assessment report:

- `ggplot2` or `gt` object
- caption
- alternative text (figures only)
- LaTeX object (tables only)

```{r eval = FALSE}
stockplotr::plot_biomass(
  dat = petrale,
  ref_line = c("target" = 260),
  unit_label = "mt",
  module = "TIME_SERIES",
  make_rda = TRUE,
  figures_dir = getwd()
)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
load("figures/biomass_figure.rda")
rda$figure
rda$caption
rda$alt_text
```

<!-- open the rda and show around -->

# Integrating {stockplotr} into the workflow

Let's reorient ourselves. We've just learned how to make figures and tables with {stockplotr}. Now, we'll cover how to add those plots into your {asar} report template.

Remember that after running the primary {asar} function-- `create_template()`- you have a 'report' folder with several files in it. These files include the report skeleton; the child documents containing the executive summary, introduction, results, and so on; and, importantly for us right now, the documents that will contain code to display your figures and tables. The files will be named something like '08_tables.qmd' and '09_figures.qmd' (the prefix numbers may vary).

Each file will contain zero figures or tables. Instead, they will contain a statement referring you to {stockplotr} so that you can make your own. Since we've created those already, let's add them to your report!

## Adding tables and figures to your report

You can add your figures and tables with two workflows:

1. Rerunning `asar::create_tables_doc()` and `asar::create_figures_doc()`
  - If you fill in arguments that allow R to find your tables and figures, then it will place them into the respective tables and figures docs automatically.
2. Adding your tables and figures manually to each doc.

### Option 1: Rerunning `asar::create_tables_doc()`/`asar::create_figures_doc()`

*This is also known as the [rda-based workflow](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/custom-figs-tabs.html#comparing-workflows)*.

#### Tables

To add tables, first ensure that your folder containing the tables is called "tables".

Then, there are only two arguments to fill out:

1. `subdir`: The location where the *new* tables doc should be saved (we recommend your 'report' folder, so it overwrites the old, empty version)
2. `tables_dir`: The location of your "tables" folder

```{r}
#| label: add-tables
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
#| messages: false
create_tables_doc(
  subdir = fs::path(getwd(), "report"), # indicates the new tables doc will be saved in your "report" folder, located in the working directory
  tables_dir = getwd() # indicates your "tables" folder is located in the working directory
                  )
```

Now, open your new tables doc and take a look!

You'll notice the following structure:

**Chunk 1** will always create an object saving the location of your `tables_dir`.

Then, there will be at least two chunks for each table. For tables that are *regularly-sized* (i.e., small enough that they don't need to be rotated or split across pages):

**Chunk 2** will:

* load an rda containing a table
* give the rda a specific name
* save the table and caption as separate objects

**Chunk 3** will:

* display the table

::: {.callout-note}
This workflow can also accommodate tables that are wide enough to require rotation into a landscape-view page OR splitting across pages. For more information, please see the ["Adding Custom Tables & Figures" vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/custom-figs-tabs.html#sec-id_width).
:::

#### Figures {#sec-rda-based-fig}

Adding figures entails nearly the same process as described for tables. The only differences are:

1. Figures will involve captions and *alternative text*, whereas tables only require captions
2. Figures do not require the option to be rotated or split across pages.

```{r}
#| label: add-figures
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
#| messages: false
create_figures_doc(
  subdir = fs::path(getwd(), "report"),
  figures_dir = getwd()
  )
```

### Option 2: Manually adding tables/figures

::: {.callout-tip}
## Outside today's scope
Learn about how to [manually add figures and tables](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_3/day_3.html#option-2-manually-adding-tablesfigures)-- i.e., directly code figures/tables in child document chunks, and reference premade figures/tables with markdown code-- on our Day 3 page!

## Referencing your tables or figures in text

Quarto uses a special notation to allow users to link tables and figures throughout their text. Use the following notation to link/reference tables in your text:

````{verbatim}
@tbl-example
````
or
````{verbatim}
@fig-example
````

Adding an `@` symbol followed by the chunk label, or label of your table/figure, will create an interactive link that lets the reader navigate to that specific table/figure.

# Render your first report draft!

Open your skeleton .qmd file, then render the report.

Run `quarto::quarto_render([path/to/your/skeleton.qmd file])` in the console. For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
quarto::quarto_render(
  file.path("report",
             "SAR_species_skeleton.qmd") # add your skeleton filename
)
```

# Adding accessibility features {#sec-a11y}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Congrats! You're almost there!
You've made major progress towards completing your first report!
:::

While your rendered report looks superb, it's probably missing two major components: **tags and alternative text**.

If you made an HTML-based report, these features would most likely be in your document. But since we're prioritizing PDFs, there are a few more steps to take before your document will significantly more accessible than it is now. This means that, **to achieve compliance with Section 508 criteria, you must complete a couple more tasks**.

## Add tagging

In your 'report' folder, you'll find a new file with a .tex filetype: 'SAR_species_skeleton.tex' (or something similar). This file is a LaTex-based version of your rendered skeleton qmd file. It's also where we add our remaining accessibility features, since Quarto does not yet offer that functionality within its qmd files.

[**Tags**](https://www.section508.gov/create/pdfs/common-tags-and-usage/) are structural elements of PDFs. They are signals telling software which information are headers, images, tables, text, and so on. Tags allow people using technology like screen readers to logically navigate PDFs.

We'll use the `asar::add_tagging()` function to add tags.

```{r eval = FALSE}
asar::add_tagging(
  x = "SAR_species_skeleton.tex", # your .tex report file
  dir = "report", # the folder containing the .tex file
  compile = FALSE # whether the .tex file should be compiled after tagging. We'll set it to FALSE for now
  )
```

Now your PDF is tagged! If you compiled your .tex file, it'd look something like this. The tags are on the right side of the PDF viewer.

![](Day_3/images/tagged_pdf.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of an example PDF-based, tagged report. The PDF is opened in Adobe and tags for the Table of Contents are shown on the right side of the screen."}

::: {.callout-warning}
## Default alt text should be updated 
If you stop here (i.e., you don't add your own alt text), this function will add the image paths as alt text. We'll show you how to add your *intended* alt text in [the next step](@sec-add-alttext).
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Break for questions
:::

## Add alternative text {#sec-add-alttext}

You must add alternative text ("alt text") for images in a separate csv if you added figures using any of the workflows described above.

Since you've used {stockplotr} to make some figures, you've already completed the first step: making a csv that will contain your alt text.

### Look at your alt text csv

The file, "captions_alt_text.csv", should be located in your working directory (enter `getwd()` if you forget where that is). Open it up.

The file is set up like this:

-   Column 1 ("label") is a shorthand label for your figure or table. Labels should be somewhat short and exclude spaces. Examples include "kobe", "relative.biomass", and "fishing.mortality".
-   Column 2 ("type") contains "figure" or "table".
-   Column 3 ("caption") contains your caption.
-   Column 4 ("alt_text") contains alternative text for figures. For tables, this column will be blank.

+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| label       | type       | caption                     | alt_text                             |
+=============+============+=============================+======================================+
| example_fig | figure     | Example caption for figure. | Example alternative text for figure. |
+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| example_tab | table      | Example caption for table.  |                                      |
+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+

: Format for csv containing table and figure captions and alternative text.

### Update the csv

Your job is to:

* *edit* existing entries for your figures already created with {stockplotr}. This entails [checking the accuracy, and writing the final component, of the existing alt text](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/accessibility_guide.html#your-to-do-list).
* *add* entries for your custom figures.

::: {.callout-important}
While we have extracted key quantities as accurately as possible, we cannot guarantee that each quantity will have been calculated perfectly. Input data varies widely. **It's your responsibility to check the accuracy of your figures' alt text.**
:::

* This prewritten alt text usually contains 3/4 essential ingredients for well-written alt text. The remaining ingredient (#4): the relationship between the variables shown (i.e., what the figure is conveying). Since we can't program {stockplotr} to analyze the figure's meaning, **you must provide this crucial component**.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Outside today's scope

:::

## Add alt text to your report's images

Now, we'll use the `asar::add_alttext()` function to add the alt text into the report's .tex file.

```{r eval = FALSE}
add_alttext(
    x = "SAR_species_skeleton.tex", # your .tex report file
    dir = "report", # the folder containing the .tex file
    alttext_csv_dir = getwd(), # the location of your "captions_alt_text.csv"
    figures_dir = getwd(), # location of your "figures" folder
    compile = TRUE # now we'll compile the PDF
  )
```

Now your PDF's figures have alt text! You can find and edit the alt text by following these steps:

![1. Open the 'All Tools' menu in Adobe. Scroll down until you reach the "Prepare for accessibility" button. Click it.](Day_3/images/Check_alttext-1.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a document opened in Adobe. The 'All Tools' menu shows a red oval around the 'Prepare for accessibility' button."}

![2. In the 'Prepare for accessibility', click the "Add alternate text" button.](Day_3/images/Check_alttext-2.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a document opened in Adobe. The 'Prepare for accessibility' menu shows a red oval around the 'Add alternate text' button."}

![3. In the 'Set alternate text' pop-up, verify that your images contain the expected alternative text and edit as necessary.](Day_3/images/Check_alttext-3.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a document opened in Adobe. The 'Set alternate text' pop-up shows where an example image's alternative text is located."}

::: {.callout-tip}
The function [`asar::add_accessibility()`](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/blob/main/R/add_accessibility.R) performs the same tasks as `asar::add_tagging()` + `asar::add_alttext()` combined! Here, we showed the latter functions to explain how they work, but you can use `asar::add_accessibility()` once you're comfortable with these steps.
