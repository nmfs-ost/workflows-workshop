# Introduction to `stockplotr`

## Installation

::: {.callout-tip}
### Tip

The following packages are already installed in the `asar` workspace on JupyterHub, so if you are using that space, you can skip this section.
:::

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nmfs-ost/asar")
pak::pak("nmfs-ost/stockplotr")
```

Please see the [`stockplotr` README](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr) for more installation options.

## `stockplotr` workflow: Basic example

### Convert output (if necessary)

First, you'll need to convert your model results using the same workflow covered yesterday: `asar::convert_output()`.

You can use the example Report.sso file uploaded to the workshop GitHub or, if you have a compatible output file, your own.

```{r}
#| label: conout-ex
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
#| messages: false
# Identify output file
output_file <- here::here("example_output", "Report.sso")
# convert the output and save it as an rda
petrale <- asar::convert_output(output_file,
                                save_dir = getwd())
```

If you have already converted your output: great! Import it into your R environment so that you can handle it as an object like "petrale" in the chunk above.

# Integrating stockplotr in the workflow

## Adding tables and figures to your report

After running `create_template()`, you'll see figures and tables files, named something like '08_tables.qmd' and '09_figures.qmd' (the prefix numbers may vary).

Each file will contain zero figures or tables. Instead, they will contain a statement referring you to {stockplotr} so that you can make your own. Since we've created those already, let's add them to your report!

You can add your figures and tables with two workflows:

1. Rerunning `asar::create_tables_doc()` and `asar::create_figures_doc()`
  - If you fill in arguments that allow R to find your tables and figures, then it will place them into the respective tables and figures docs automatically.
2. Adding your tables and figures manually to each doc.

### Option 1: Rerunning `asar::create_tables_doc()`/`asar::create_figures_doc()`

*This is also known as the [rda-based workflow](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/custom-figs-tabs.html#comparing-workflows)*.

#### Tables

To add tables, first ensure that your folder containing the tables is called "tables".

Then, there are only two arguments to fill out:

1. `subdir`: The location where the *new* tables doc should be saved (we recommend your 'report' folder, so it overwrites the old, empty version)
2. `tables_dir`: The location of your "tables" folder

```{r}
#| label: add-tables
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
#| messages: false
create_tables_doc(
  subdir = fs::path(getwd(), "report"), # indicates the new tables doc will be saved in your "report" folder, located in the working directory
  tables_dir = getwd() # indicates your "tables" folder is located in the working directory
                  )
```

Now, open your new tables doc and take a look!

You'll notice the following structure:

**Chunk 1** will always create an object saving the location of your `tables_dir`.

Then, there will be at least two chunks for each table. For tables that are *regularly-sized* (i.e., small enough that they don't need to be rotated or split across pages):

**Chunk 2** will:

* load an rda containing a table
* give the rda a specific name
* save the table and caption as separate objects

**Chunk 3** will:

* display the table

::: {.callout-note}
This workflow can also accommodate tables that are wide enough to require rotation into a landscape-view page OR splitting across pages. For more information, please see the ["Adding Custom Tables & Figures" vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/custom-figs-tabs.html#sec-id_width).
:::

#### Figures

Adding figures entails nearly the same process as described for tables. The only differences are:

1. Figures will involve captions and *alternative text*, whereas tables only require captions
2. Figures do not require the option to be rotated or split across pages.

### Option 2: Manually adding tables/figures

#### Tables

You can add a regularly-sized^[Again, for tables that require rotating or splitting across pages, please refer to the ["Adding Custom Tables & Figures" vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/custom-figs-tabs.html#sec-id_width).] table/figure manually by following these main steps:

1. Create a code chunk
2. Add your label and other chunk options
3. Add code
4. Write caption
5. Add a page break between tables (optional but recommended)

##### Direct coding-in-qmd table workflow 

Example from the ["Adding Custom Tables & Figures" vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/custom-figs-tabs.html#direct-coding-in-qmd-workflow-option-3-2):

````{verbatim}
```{r} 
#| label: 'tbl-custom1' # choose a label
#| tbl-cap: !expr This is your table caption.

# Import your data
petrale <- load(fs::path("std_output.rda"))

# Make your table
your_table <- head(petrale) |>
  dplyr::select(label, year, estimate) |>
  flextable::flextable()

# Show your table
your_table
``` 
````

![](images/petrale_table.png){fig-alt="Example of a table produced with the 'Direct coding-in-qmd table workflow' option for adding tables to `asar` reports."}

Then, add a pagebreak:

```{r} 
#| label: 'pgbreak'
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

{{< pagebreak >}}

``` 

::: {.callout-warning}
It will be important to add your captions and labels into a csv file when making your documents accessible. You will soon learn more about this in the the ["Adding accessibility features" section](#sec-a11y)!
:::


##### Direct image-based table insertion workflow

We don't recommended adding tables as images, since it significantly reduces the accessibility of your table. However, we understand that sometimes this is the only format available.

Use the following notation to reference an external table as an image:

`![Caption for my example table](example_table.png){fig-alt="This is the alternative text for my table", #tbl-example}`

::: {.callout-note}
Notice how there is alternative text added to this method of adding a table. In this scenario, the table is recognized as an image and thus would NOT pass accessibility checks. **Please make sure you add alternative text for image-based tables added in this way.**
:::

#### Figures

##### Direct coding-in-qmd figure workflow

Like with tables, running `create_figures_doc()` produces a blank figures quarto file. We add figures similarly to tables. In fact, the only major difference is that you must write **alternative text** for your figure.

Put your alternative text in a chunk option called 'fig-alt' (example below).

````{verbatim}
```{r} 
#| label: 'fig-custom1' # choose a label
#| fig-cap: !expr This is your figure caption.
#| fig-alt: !expr This is your figure alternative text.

# Import your data
load(fs::path("std_output.rda"))

petrale <- out_new |>
                    dplyr::filter(year > 1980) |>
                    dplyr::filter(module_name == "TIME_SERIES") |>
                    dplyr::filter(label == "biomass") |>
                    dplyr::filter(!is.na(fleet))

# Make your figure
your_figure <- ggplot2::ggplot(petrale,
  ggplot2::aes(x = year, y = estimate, color = fleet)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(linewidth = 0.75) +
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::theme_classic()

# Show your figure
your_figure
``` 
````

![](images/petrale_figure.png){fig-alt="Example of a figure produced with the 'Direct coding-in-qmd figure workflow' option for adding figures to `asar` reports."}

::: {.callout-warning}
Even though you wrote alt text in the `fig-alt` area, **when you first render your report into a PDF, your alternative text will not show up in your document.** Strange, right?! **To ensure it shows up, refer to the ["Adding accessibility features" section](#sec-a11y)** (which we'll discuss in a moment).
:::

##### Direct image-based figure insertion workflow

Like tables, you can reference figures not made directly in code chunks. However, in this case, this does *not* change the accessibility of the figure because you can still add the necessary components to meet Section 508 compliance standards: alternative text and a caption.

`![Caption for my example figure](example_figure.png){fig-alt="This is the alternative text for my figure", #fig-example}`

## Referencing your tables or figures in text

Quarto uses a special notation to allow users to link tables and figures throughout their text. Use the following notation to link/reference tables in your text:

`\@tbl-example` or `\@fig-example`

Adding an `@` symbol followed by the chunk label, or label of your table/figure, will create an interactive link that lets the reader navigate to that specific table/figure.

## Render your first report draft!

Open your skeleton qmd file, then render the report. You've made major progress towards creating your first report!

You can render a report in three ways:

### In the R console

Run `quarto::quarto_render([path/to/your/skeleton.qmd file])` in the console. For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
quarto::quarto_render(
  here::here("report",
             "SAR_species_skeleton.qmd") # add your skeleton filename
)
```

### With the RStudio "render" button

Open the skeleton.qmd file. Then, in the program pane, press the "render" button:

![](images/render_button.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the RStudio console with a red rectangle highlighting the location of the 'Render' button."}

### In the terminal

Run `quarto render [path/to/your/skeleton.qmd file]` in the terminal. For example:

Enter `quarto render report/SAR_species_skeleton.qmd`

# Adding accessibility features {#sec-a11y}



# Demo for a realistic, customized asar report with stockplotr plots

- create_tables_doc() and create_figures_doc() with "figures" and "tables" folders
- ensure alt text/captions work
