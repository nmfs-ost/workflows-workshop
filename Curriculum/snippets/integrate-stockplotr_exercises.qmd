## Practice exercises: Add figures/tables and render report

1. Ensure that you have a 'figures' folder and a 'tables' folder, each with at least one rda file. If you don't, export a couple of figures and tables.
   * *Hint:* ensure that the `make_rda` argument is set to TRUE when running the {stockplotr} functions that create figures and tables).

2. Open up your figures and tables qmds, in the 'report' folder. If these documents do not contain the necessary chunks to import and display at least one plot, rerun `create_figures_doc()` and/or `create_tables_doc()` to add code that will plot the figures/tables in your 'figures' and 'tables' folders.
   * *Hint:* ensure that the arguments are correct: `subdir` and `figures_dir` (for the figures doc) / `tables_dir` (for the tables doc)
   * *Hint:* This step practices the ["rda-based workflow"](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_3/day_3.html#option-1-rerunning-asarcreate_tables_docasarcreate_figures_doc).

3. Practice adding a figure with markdown notation by adding the image of a landings figure into the figures doc. The figure is located in the ['example_plots' folder](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/workflows-workshop/blob/main/example_plots/landings_fig_png.png). Set the caption to "Historical landings by fleet.", the alternative text to "Cumulative line plot showing historical landings for North and South fleets. The x axis shows the year, which spans from 1850 to 2026. The y axis shows landings in metric tons, which spans from 0 to 2,400.", and the figure label to "practice-figure-label".
    * *Hint:* This step practices the ["direct image-based workflow"](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_3/day_3.html#direct-image-based-table-insertion-workflow).

4. In the Executive Summary, add a reference to the first figure in your figures qmd file.

## **Answers** for Practice exercises: Add figures/tables and render report

3. Practice adding a figure with markdown notation by adding the image of a landings figure into the figures doc. The figure is located in the ['example_plots' folder](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/workflows-workshop/blob/main/example_plots/landings_fig_png.png). Set the caption to "Historical landings by fleet.", the alternative text to "Cumulative line plot showing historical landings for North and South fleets. The x axis shows the year, which spans from 1850 to 2026. The y axis shows landings in metric tons, which spans from 0 to 2,400.", and the figure label to "practice-figure-label".
   *Hint:* This step practices the ["direct image-based workflow"](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/workflows-workshop/Curriculum/Day_3/day_3.html#direct-image-based-table-insertion-workflow).

**Answer**: Add the following chunk to the figures doc:

```{r eval = FALSE}
![Historical landings by fleet.](example_plots/landings_fig_png.png){fig-alt="Cumulative line plot showing historical landings for North and South fleets. The x axis shows the year, which spans from 1850 to 2026. The y axis shows landings in metric tons, which spans from 0 to 2,400.", #practice-figure-label}
```

4. In the Executive Summary, add a reference to the first figure in your figures qmd file.

**Answer**: If the 'label' for that first figure is 'fig-custom1', then the in-text reference would be '\@fig-custom1'.
