# Terminology

The following are a list of terms we may use throughout the workshop that might be new or relatively new to some users:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Absolute filepath | A filepath that starts in relation to the root directory (oftentimes the start of your hard drive). For example, the absolute filepath for a file "C:/Documents/metadata.qmd" would be "C:/Documents/metadata.qmd". |
| Relative filepath | A filepath that starts in relation to the working directory. For example, if the working directory is "C:/Documents/", then the relative filepath for a file "C:/Documents/metadata.qmd" would be "metadata.qmd". |
| Render | Synonymous with compile; build the document to produce a single html or pdf report |
| Skeleton | The central controlling Quarto document created from {asar}. The document filename will contain 'skeleton' |
| Working directory | The place where your program looks for files. If you are working within an R Project, the working directory is the folder that contains every file within your project. You can identify it with the `getwd()` command. |
