# Good data science practices

## Organization

1. Use the [`here` R package](https://here.r-lib.org/). As stated on their website: "The goal of the `here` package is to enable easy file referencing in [project-oriented workflows](https://rstats.wtf/projects.html). In contrast to using `setwd()`, which is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files, `here` uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files." This is especially useful when you're collaborating with others on the same files.

## Seeking help

1. Create a reproducible example ("reprex") to allow your helper to reproduce your issue and get a clear sense of the context. See [the tidyverse's "do's and don'ts"](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html) for making reprexes.
