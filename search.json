    "text": "asar\n\nInstallation\nAttendees of the workshop should have already downloaded this package during day 1. If you have not, please download asar through the following code:\n\npak::pak(\"nmfs-ost/asar\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you receive an error message when attempting the download the package, please ask the isntructor for alternative directions or see the README on the asar repository.\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nIn this section we will cover the basics of asar by generating a blank stock assessement report and going through basic navigation of the template.\n\nRecommended workflow\nWe highly recommend using a project based workflow meaning creating an R project for each report. This makes returning to your session and maintaining files easier. Using either a project or GitHub repository will help you in the long run.\nTo create a new R project in Rstudio:\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; New or Existing Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you use VSCode or Positron for your IDE, by navigating to a folder on your computer, it will automatically initialize a project-like environment.\n\n\n\n\nOur Package\nasar revolves around 4 primary functions, but contains a variety of support functions that help make the template. While most of them are accessible to the user, they would not perform helpful functions for them. We will be going over the following functions:\n-   `create_template()`\n-   `convert_output()`\n-   `create_tables_doc()`\n-   `create_figures_doc()`\n** Time to browse documentation? or show info from site? **\n\ncreate_template\nWhat it does:\nGenerates a set of files that setup a stock assessment report with its supporting files.\nWithin the created files is the “skeleton file” which drives the render of the entire report. For those familiar with Rmarkdown or Quarto books, this is operating similar to a .yml file. The other quarto files found in your folder will be what we refer to as “child documents”, or child docs for short. These are the actual files that you will fill in when writing your report. These are the bulk of your content!\nTry it out!\ncreate_template() contains A LOT of arguments that allow the user to customize their document how they want. The function contains a set of defaults that would produce a template that could be rendered, but contains no real information relevant to the target stock.\nSo, let’s do more than just create a blank template! The following arguments are some key parts to fill in for a specific stock assessment report:\n\n\n\nArgument\nOptions\n\n\n\n\nformat\npdf, html\n\n\ntype\nSAR, pfmc, safe\n\n\noffice\nafsc, pifsc, nefsc, nwfsc sefsc, swfsc\n\n\nregion\n-\n\n\nspecies\n-\n\n\nspp_latin\n-\n\n\nyear\n-\n\n\nauthors\n-\n\n\nfile_dir\n-\n\n\n\n\n# Adjust below example based on audience\nlibrary(asar)\nlibrary(here)\ncreate_template(\n  format = \"pdf\", # optional \"html\"\n  type = \"SAR\", # add'l options: \"safe\", \"nemt\", \"pfmc\"\n  office = \"NWFSC\",\n  region = \"U.S. West Coast\",\n  species = \"Petrale sole\",\n  spp_latin = \"Eopsetta jordani\",\n  authors = c(\"Samantha Schiano\" = \"OST\"),\n  file_dir = here::here()\n)\n\nRun it!\nYou should see a folder called “report” where you indicated in the argument file_dir. It should have a set up that looks like this:\n\n\n\nThe contents of an asar generated template found in the report folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should see a variety of messaged reported in the console to indicate that it worked! For a blank template with no errors, it should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a tour of the content we created!\nThe Skeleton\n\n\n\nDiagram showing different blocks of content found in the Quarto yaml within the skeleton.qmd file.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, the skeleton file controls the rest of the report. This is the file you go to to compile your report, change formatting, or add quantities to reference in your document.\nWe went over the basics of a Quarto yaml in Day 1, but when using asar, you don’t actually have to fill in anything yourself. The beauty of using asar is that it removes this task, but filling out information provided in the create_template() arguments and providing the template custom formatting that is part of the package (and the NOAA standard!).\n\n\n\n‘asar’ yaml controlling formatting and basic document information.\n\n\nThe YAML controls the following:\n- title\n- authorship\n- formatting\n- rendered file name\n- parameters\n- species cover image\n- bibliography\n- citation style\nParameterization\nQuarto has a cool feature that allows users to parameterize their document by utilizing markdown’s ability to render in-line code throughout your writing. In the yaml, there are pre-added parameters of the species, Latin name, region, and office. These are called in through an R chunk after the YAML.\nYou have two options for calling these parameters in your writing.\n(1) \\` r params$species \\` (Quarto parameterization)\n(2) \\` r species \\` (asar use of parameterization)\nThe Preamble\nThe preamble is an R chunk that loads in a script called “preamble.R” which extracts key quantities commonly referenced in stock assessment reports. This will only work with a standard results file converted using asar::convert_output(), which we will get to shortly.\n\n\n\nA screenshot showing lines of code in an R chunk within the skeleton file containing various quantities pulled from the preamble.R script.\n\n\nThe quantities in found in this chunk can be referenced in-line throughout the document:\n` r R0 `\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more information on markdown notation, see Day 1 of this workshop or navigate to our article on the topic!\n\n\nDemo of where to find preamble quantities and methods to adding to it\nThe Content\nThe “child docs” are where you as the assessment author or contributor report out the information you need to include. The template is highly modular so there are files for each section of the report and sometimes files for subsections. The default asar template creates child docs following the NOAA standard stock assessment report guidelines consisting of the following:\n- executive summary\n- introduction\n- data\n- assessment (modelling and results)\n- discussion\n- acknowledgements\n- references\n- tables\n- figures\n- appendix\nEach child doc contains pre-determined headers and labels for the author to reference back to throughout the document. There are also descriptions within each section that depcit what you should report on throughout the document. You can either keep or remove these notes once the document is finished, either way, they will not be included in your final report.\nChild docs are not intended to be rendered on their own, but only from the skeleton as a whole!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe are advising everyone that if required content is needed beyond the standard guidelines, that it gets placed in the appendix; however we encourage everyone to think about the importance of the content in terms of review for management versus CIE or SSC review.\n\n\nDemo of child docs and adding quantities from the preamble into your document\n\n\n\n\nBreak\n15 minute break\n\nconvert_output\nAnother major component of asar is our converter function which converts an output file from a stock assessment model to a standard format which can be used by the preamble and our other package stockplotr.\nThe convert_output function currently accepts output from Stock Synthesis (Report.sso) version 3.30 and higher, Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM; output.rda), or Fishereies Integrated Modelling System (FIMS; R object). We are actively working on expanding the convert_output function to be compatiable with all major U.S. stock assessment models. This function takes a lot of resources to develop, so any contribution to the package is welcome! If you have a model that is not currently compatible with asar::convert_output(), please navigate to our article describing the function and how to get your output in the same format as those produced from the converter!\nLet’s try it out!\nWe have uploaded an example Report.sso file in the workshop GitHub, but if you have a compatible output file, we encourage you to use your own.\n\n# Identify output file\noutput_file &lt;- here::here(\"example_output\", \"Report.sso\")\n# convert the output\npetrale &lt;- asar::convert_output(output_file)\n\n\npetrale",

    "text": "Why use Quarto for reports?\nQuarto is an ideal platform for building reproducible reports, which are denoted with a .qmd (Quarto Markdown) extension type. Why?\n\nIt allows you to combine narrative text, source code (like R), and the outputs of that code (like tables and figures) into a single, polished document.\nAnyone with the same files can reproduce that document, which goes a long way in promoting scientific integrity.\nYou can produce reports in several formats like HTML, PDF, and Word.",

    "section": "Skeleton setup",
    "text": "Skeleton setup\nWhen you run asar::create_template(), you will receive a “report” folder with several files within it. One of the most important files is what we call the “skeleton”: a .qmd file containing chunks that run other files, then places the rendered contents of those files within one report.\nThose other files are what we call “child documents”. For example, your report introduction will be written in a child document. Your figures and tables will be placed in respective child docs, too.\nThis setup avoids placing your entire report in one massive .qmd file, facilitates asynchronous collaboration with your colleagues, and keeps your project organized.\n\nRelative pathnames\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOnly files with paths relative to the Quarto doc will load!\n\n\nQuarto projects are self-contained such that it can only find files if you tell it where to look relative to the location of the .qmd file. To Quarto, the location of that .qmd file essentially becomes the root of your directory.\nFor example, imagine your project has this structure:\nreport/\n├── SAR_species_skeleton.qmd\n├── 01_executive_summary.qmd\n├── 02_introduction.qmd\n└── extra_data/\n    └── red_fish.csv\n    └── blue_fish.csv\nTo load ‘red_fish.csv’ inside SAR_species_skeleton.qmd, you would use a relative path:\n\nmy_data &lt;- read.csv(\"extra_data/red_fish.csv\")\n\nThis would work even if your working directory is not the “report” folder.",
