For tables that are regularly-sized (i.e., small enough that they don’t need to be rotated or split across pages):\nChunk 2 will:\n\nload an rda containing a table\ngive the rda a specific name\nsave the table and caption as separate objects\n\nChunk 3 will:\n\ndisplay the table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis workflow can also accommodate tables that are wide enough to require rotation into a landscape-view page OR splitting across pages. For more information, please see the “Adding Custom Tables & Figures” vignette.\n\n\n\n\nFigures\nAdding figures entails nearly the same process as described for tables. The only differences are:\n\nFigures will involve captions and alternative text, whereas tables only require captions\nFigures do not require the option to be rotated or split across pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak for questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: Manually adding tables/figures\n\nTables\nYou can add a regularly-sized1 table/figure manually by following these main steps:\n\nCreate a code chunk\nAdd your label and other chunk options\nAdd code\nWrite caption\nAdd a page break between tables (optional but recommended)\n\n\nDirect coding-in-qmd table workflow\nExample from the “Adding Custom Tables & Figures” vignette:\n```{r} \n#| label: 'tbl-custom1' # choose a label\n#| tbl-cap: !expr This is your table caption.\n\n# Import your data\npetrale &lt;- load(fs::path(\"std_output.rda\"))\n\n# Make your table\nyour_table &lt;- head(petrale) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(label, year, estimate) |&gt;\n  flextable::flextable()\n\n# Show your table\nyour_table\n``` \n\nThen, add a pagebreak:\n\n{{&lt; pagebreak &gt;}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt will be important to add your captions and labels into a csv file when making your documents accessible. You will soon learn more about this in the the “Adding accessibility features” section!\n\n\n\n\nDirect image-based table insertion workflow\nWe don’t recommended adding tables as images, since it significantly reduces the accessibility of your table. However, we understand that sometimes this is the only format available.\nUse the following notation to reference an external table as an image:\n![Caption for my example table](example_table.png){fig-alt=\"This is the alternative text for my table\", #tbl-example}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice how there is alternative text added to this method of adding a table. In this scenario, the table is recognized as an image and thus would NOT pass accessibility checks. Please make sure you add alternative text for image-based tables added in this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures\n\nDirect coding-in-qmd figure workflow\nLike with tables, running create_figures_doc() produces a blank figures quarto file. We add figures similarly to tables. In fact, the only major difference is that you must write alternative text for your figure.\nPut your alternative text in a chunk option called ‘fig-alt’ (example below).\n```{r} \n#| label: 'fig-custom1' # choose a label\n#| fig-cap: !expr This is your figure caption.\n#| fig-alt: !expr This is your figure alternative text.\n\n# Import your data\nload(fs::path(\"std_output.rda\"))\n\npetrale &lt;- out_new |&gt;\n                    dplyr::filter(year &gt; 1980) |&gt;\n                    dplyr::filter(module_name == \"TIME_SERIES\") |&gt;\n                    dplyr::filter(label == \"biomass\") |&gt;\n                    dplyr::filter(!is.na(fleet))\n\n# Make your figure\nyour_figure &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(petrale,\n  ggplot2::aes(x = year, y = estimate, color = fleet)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(linewidth = 0.75) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::theme_classic()\n\n# Show your figure\nyour_figure\n``` \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nEven though you wrote alt text in the fig-alt area, when you first render your report into a PDF, your alternative text will not show up in your document. Strange, right?! To ensure it shows up, refer to the “Adding accessibility features” section (which we’ll discuss in a moment).\n\n\n\n\nDirect image-based figure insertion workflow\nLike tables, you can reference figures not made directly in code chunks. However, in this case, this does not change the accessibility of the figure because you can still add the necessary components to meet Section 508 compliance standards: alternative text and a caption.\n![Caption for my example figure](example_figure.png){fig-alt=\"This is the alternative text for my figure\", #fig-example}",

    "text": "Add alternative text\nYou must add alternative text (“alt text”) for images in a separate csv if you added figures using any of the workflows described above.\nSince you’ve used stockplotr to make some figures, you’ve already completed the first step: making a csv that will contain your alt text.\n\nLook at your alt text csv\nThe file, “captions_alt_text.csv”, should be located in your working directory (enter getwd() if you forget where that is). Open it up.\nThe file is set up like this:\n\nColumn 1 (“label”) is a shorthand label for your figure or table. Labels should be somewhat short and exclude spaces. Examples include “kobe”, “relative.biomass”, and “fishing.mortality”.\nColumn 2 (“type”) contains “figure” or “table”.\nColumn 3 (“caption”) contains your caption.\nColumn 4 (“alt_text”) contains alternative text for figures. For tables, this column will be blank.\n\n\nFormat for csv containing table and figure captions and alternative text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabel\ntype\ncaption\nalt_text\n\n\n\n\nexample_fig\nfigure\nExample caption for figure.\nExample alternative text for figure.\n\n\nexample_tab\ntable\nExample caption for table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the csv\nYour job is to:\n\nedit existing entries for your figures already created with stockplotr. This entails checking the accuracy, and writing the final component, of the existing alt text.\nadd entries for your custom figures.\n\n\nEditing existing entries\nUsing the “label” column, find the row associated with your figure and inspect it.\n\nYou’ll see that there’s already some prewritten alt text (in the “alt_text” column) that includes data from the model results file. Now, you must check this information for accuracy and update it where necessary (especially if the default figures were modified).\nIf you see text that looks like a placeholder (e.g., “The x axis, showing the year, spans from B.start.year to B.end.year…”), that means that there was at least one instance where our tool failed to extract a specific value from the model results, calculate a key quantity (like the start year of a biomass plot- aka “B.start.year”), and substitute it into the placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile we have extracted key quantities as accurately as possible, we cannot guarantee that each quantity will have been calculated perfectly. Input data varies widely. It’s your responsibility to check the accuracy of your figures’ alt text.\n\n\n\nThis prewritten alt text usually contains 3/4 essential ingredients for well-written alt text. The remaining ingredient (#4): the relationship between the variables shown (i.e., what the figure is conveying). Since we can’t program stockplotr to analyze the figure’s meaning, you must provide this crucial component.\n\nWhen you’re satisfied, save the csv.\n\n\nAdding new entries\n\nMake a new row.\nFor “label”, take the “label” of your figure chunk. For example, in the example above, the label would be “fig-custom1”.\nThe type will be “figure”.\nThe caption should be identical to the caption in your chunk (what you put in “fig-cap”).\nThe “alt_text” will contain your alt text. See the “Editing existing entries” section above, and the “Achieve Greater Accessibility” vignette, for help writing alt text.\n\nWhen you’re satisfied, save the csv.",

    "section": "The main asar functions",
    "text": "The main asar functions\nasar revolves around 4 primary functions, but contains a variety of support functions that help make the template. While most of them are accessible to the user, they would not perform helpful functions for them. We will be going over the following functions:\n\ncreate_template()\nconvert_output()\ncreate_tables_doc()\ncreate_figures_doc()\n\n** Time to browse documentation? or show info from site? **\n\ncreate_template()\nWhat it does:\nGenerates a set of files that setup a stock assessment report with its supporting files.\nWithin the created files is the “skeleton file” which drives the render of the entire report. For those familiar with Rmarkdown or Quarto books, this is operating similar to a .yml file. The other quarto files found in your folder will be what we refer to as “child documents”, or child docs for short. These are the actual files that you will fill in when writing your report. These are the bulk of your content!\nTry it out!\ncreate_template() contains A LOT of arguments that allow the user to customize their document how they want. The function contains a set of defaults that would produce a template that could be rendered, but contains no real information relevant to the target stock.\nSo, let’s do more than just create a blank template! The following arguments are some key parts to fill in for a specific stock assessment report:\n\n\n\nArgument\nOptions\n\n\n\n\nformat\npdf, html\n\n\ntype\nSAR, pfmc, safe\n\n\noffice\nafsc, pifsc, nefsc, nwfsc sefsc, swfsc\n\n\nregion\n-\n\n\nspecies\n-\n\n\nspp_latin\n-\n\n\nyear\n-\n\n\nauthors\n-\n\n\nfile_dir\n-\n\n\n\n\n# Adjust below example based on audience\nlibrary(asar)\nlibrary(here)\ncreate_template(\n  format = \"pdf\", # optional \"html\"\n  type = \"SAR\", # add'l options: \"safe\", \"nemt\", \"pfmc\"\n  office = \"NWFSC\",\n  region = \"U.S. West Coast\",\n  species = \"Petrale sole\",\n  spp_latin = \"Eopsetta jordani\",\n  authors = c(\"Samantha Schiano\" = \"OST\"),\n  file_dir = here::here()\n)\n\nRun it!\nYou should see a folder called “report” where you indicated in the argument file_dir. It should have a set up that looks like this:\n\n\n\nThe contents of an asar generated template found in the report folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should see a variety of messaged reported in the console to indicate that it worked! For a blank template with no errors, it should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak for questions\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a tour of the content we created!\n\nThe skeleton\n\n\n\nDiagram showing different blocks of content found in the Quarto yaml within the skeleton.qmd file.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, the skeleton file controls the rest of the report. This is the file you go to to compile your report, change formatting, or add quantities to reference in your document.\nWe went over the basics of a Quarto yaml in Day 1, but when using asar, you don’t actually have to fill in anything yourself. The beauty of using asar is that it removes this task, but filling out information provided in the create_template() arguments and providing the template custom formatting that is part of the package (and the NOAA standard!).\n\n\n\n‘asar’ yaml controlling formatting and basic document information.\n\n\nThe YAML controls the following:\n\ntitle\nauthorship\nformatting\nrendered file name\nparameters\nspecies cover image\nbibliography\ncitation style\n\n\n\nParameterization\nQuarto has a cool feature that allows users to parameterize their document by utilizing markdown’s ability to render in-line code throughout your writing. In the yaml, there are pre-added parameters of the species, Latin name, region, and office. These are called in through an R chunk after the YAML.\nYou have two options for calling these parameters in your writing.\n\n` r params$species ` (Quarto parameterization)\n` r species ` (asar use of parameterization)\n\n\n\nThe preamble\nThe preamble is an R chunk that loads in a script called “preamble.R” which extracts key quantities commonly referenced in stock assessment reports. This will only work with a standard results file converted using asar::convert_output(), which we will get to shortly.\n\n\n\nA screenshot showing lines of code in an R chunk within the skeleton file containing various quantities pulled from the preamble.R script.\n\n\nThe quantities in found in this chunk can be referenced in-line throughout the document:\n` r R0 `\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more information on markdown notation, see Day 1 of this workshop or navigate to our article on the topic!\n\n\nDemo of where to find preamble quantities and methods to adding to it\n\n\nThe content\nThe “child docs” are where you as the assessment author or contributor report out the information you need to include. The template is highly modular so there are files for each section of the report and sometimes files for subsections. The default asar template creates child docs following the NOAA standard stock assessment report guidelines consisting of the following:\n\nexecutive summary\nintroduction\ndata\nassessment (modelling and results)\ndiscussion\nacknowledgements\nreferences\ntables\nfigures\nappendix\n\nEach child doc contains pre-determined headers and labels for the author to reference back to throughout the document. There are also descriptions within each section that depcit what you should report on throughout the document. You can either keep or remove these notes once the document is finished, either way, they will not be included in your final report.\nChild docs are not intended to be rendered on their own, but only from the skeleton as a whole!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe are advising everyone that if required content is needed beyond the standard guidelines, that it gets placed in the appendix; however we encourage everyone to think about the importance of the content in terms of review for management versus CIE or SSC review.\n\n\nDemo of child docs and adding quantities from the preamble into your document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 minute break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconvert_output()\nAnother major component of asar is our converter function which converts an output file from a stock assessment model to a standard format which can be used by the preamble and our other package stockplotr.\nThe convert_output function currently accepts output from Stock Synthesis (Report.sso) version 3.30 and higher, Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM; output.rda), or Fishereies Integrated Modelling System (FIMS; R object). We are actively working on expanding the convert_output function to be compatiable with all major U.S. stock assessment models. This function takes a lot of resources to develop, so any contribution to the package is welcome! If you have a model that is not currently compatible with asar::convert_output(), please navigate to our article describing the function and how to get your output in the same format as those produced from the converter!\nLet’s try it out!\nWe have uploaded an example Report.sso file in the workshop GitHub, but if you have a compatible output file, we encourage you to use your own.\n\n# Identify output file\noutput_file &lt;- here::here(\"example_output\", \"Report.sso\")\n# convert the output\npetrale &lt;- asar::convert_output(output_file)\n\n\npetrale",

When you “knit” the document, the code is executed, and the results— like figures, tables, parameters, citations, and other outputs— are automatically inserted into the final report.\nA major reason why R markdown is incredibly useful: it saves time and reduces errors. If your data changes, you don’t have to manually rerun your analysis and copy/paste the results. You just re-knit the document, and everything is updated automatically.",

    "text": "Common uses in asar reports\nNow, let’s dive into some of the most common features you’ll be using when creating asar reports.\n\nParameters\nParameters allow you to create dynamic reports. You can define parameters in the YAML header and then reference them in your text and code.\nFor example, you could have a parameter for the species you’re writing about:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Stock Assessment Report\"\nauthor: \"Patrick Star\"\ndate: today\nparams:\n  species: \"Petrale sole\"\n---\n\nThen, in the body of your report, you can reference this parameter like this:\n“The native range of `params$species` spans from…”\nWhen you knit the document, `params$species` will be replaced with “Petrale sole”.\n\n\nFormatting\nR Markdown uses a simple syntax for formatting your text. Here are some of the most common formatting options:\n\nHeaders\n\n# signifies a top-level header\n## signifies a second-level header (etc.)\n\nEmphasis\n\n*italic* for italic text\n**bold** for bold text\n\nLists\n\nUnordered lists: Use * or - at the beginning of a line.\nOrdered lists: Use numbers followed by a period.\n\nLinks\n\n[link text](URL)\n\n\n\n\nMath and Equations\nYou can include LaTeX-style math equations in your report.\n\nInline math: Wrap your equation in single dollar signs: $A = \\pi * r^2$\nBlock equations: Wrap your equation in double dollar signs to display it on its own line: $$     E = mc^2     $$\n\n\n\nReferences and Bibliography\nYou can easily add citations to your report. We provide an asar_references.bib file in the “report” folder with hundreds of citations for you to reference, though you can add your own to the file too.\nTo cite a reference in the text, use the @ symbol followed by the citation key (e.g., @Biddle_1992). R Markdown will automatically format the citation and add it to the “References” section towards the end of your report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 minute break",

One of the most important files is what we call the “skeleton”: a .qmd file containing chunks that run other files, then places the rendered contents of those files within one report.\nThose other files are what we call “child documents”. For example, your report introduction will be written in a child document. Your figures and tables will be placed in respective child docs, too.\nThis setup avoids placing your entire report in one massive .qmd file, facilitates asynchronous collaboration with your colleagues, and keeps your project organized.\n\nRelative pathnames\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOnly files with paths relative to the Quarto doc will load!\n\n\nQuarto projects are self-contained such that it can only find files if you tell it where to look relative to the location of the .qmd file. To Quarto, the location of that .qmd file essentially becomes the root of your directory.\nFor example, imagine your project has this structure:\nreport/\n├── SAR_species_skeleton.qmd\n├── 01_executive_summary.qmd\n├── 02_introduction.qmd\n└── extra_data/\n    └── red_fish.csv\n    └── blue_fish.csv\nTo load ‘red_fish.csv’ inside SAR_species_skeleton.qmd, you would use a relative path:\n\nmy_data &lt;- read.csv(\"extra_data/red_fish.csv\")\n\nThis would work even if your working directory is not the “report” folder.",
