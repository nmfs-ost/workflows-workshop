While this is not generally recommended since it significaly reduces the accessibility of your table, we understand that sometimes this is the only format you have it in.\nUse the following notation to reference an external table as an image:\n![Caption for my example table](example_table.png){fig-alt=\"This is the alternative text for my table\", #tbl-example}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice how there is alternative text added to this method of adding a table.

However, in this case, this does not change the accessibility of the figure as much because you as the user can still add the necessary components to meet section 508 standards.\n![Caption for my example figure](example_figure.png){fig-alt=\"This is the alternative text for my figure\", #fig-example}\n\n\nReferencing your tables or figures in text\nQuarto uses a special notation to allow users to link tables and figures throughout their text. Use the following notation to link/reference tables in your text:\n“Table 1” or “Figure 1”\nBy adding an @ symbol followed by the chunk label or just label of your table/figure will create an interactive link that lets the reader navigate to that specific table/figure.\n[Show working example within positron]\nPut it all together!\nRender your entire document and take a look at what we’ve made today."
